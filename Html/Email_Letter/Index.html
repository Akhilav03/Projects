                    <p>
                        Hey <b>Akhila</b>, <br>
                        February was a busy month for us at Unsplash! Here's a summary of what we've been up to recently:

                    <h2>Medium + Unsplash ðŸ’œ</h2>
                    <p>
                        We announced that the entire library of 400,000+ high-resolution Unsplash photos is now available in Medium.</p><p>Image credit links to the contributor are baked in and the team at Medium took extra care to automatically re-size photos to make them look beautiful on all screens.
                    </p>

                    <p>Medium is a megaphone for ideas. And our hope is Unsplash can help turn up the volume even more.</p>
